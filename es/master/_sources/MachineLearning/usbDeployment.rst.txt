USB Camera Deployment for Raspberry Pi
####################################################

This section shows you how to deploy object detection models onto the Raspberry Pi using a USB camera.  The Pi must be pre-installed with the `WPILibPi <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/releases>`_ image.  We'll show two methods for running object detection.  You can use the OpenCV `Deep Neural Networks Module <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d2/d58/tutorial_table_of_content_dnn.html>`_ (DNN module), or you can deploy using a `Tensorflow Lite <https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python>`_ model file.  In both cases you'll need to have a TPU accelerator, such as the `Coral USB Accelerator <https://coral.ai/products/accelerator>`_, connected to the Pi in order to run inference  at an exceptable speed for competition.  However, you can still test without an accelerator.

Installing the FRC Detection Package  
********************************************************

To facilitate the deployment the package `FRC-Romi-Detection-Models <https://github.com/FRC-2928/FRC-Romi-Deployment-Models>`_ can be used.  This package contains the python inference scripts and example model files that detect the *Rapid-React* balls from the 2022 competition. It also contains the **runCamera** script to start inference via the Romi Web UI.

To install the detection package:

.. code-block::   

        cd ${HOME}
        git clone https://github.com/FRC-2928/FRC-Romi-Deployment-Models.git


Install the addition python requirements for the FRC scripts. The requirements are `Pillow`, **argparse**, and **tflite-support**.

.. code-block::  

        cd ${HOME}/FRC-Romi-Deployment-Models
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt   

Run Inference using OpenCV DNN
***************************************

The OpenCV DNN module uses the **.weights** file that's generated from the training process.  There's no need to convert this file to another format, such as a tflite file.  You'll also need the configuration **.cfg** and the class labels **.names** file that you used for training.  All three of these files should have been saved from the training process. Examples of these files are included in the *FRC-Romi-Detection-Models* package.

To run the script for the OpenCV DNN module:

.. code-block:: Python  

        python3 dnn_yolo_wpi.py --model rapid-react

where the **--model** parameter is used to pass in the file path and name of your model files.  See **The Inference Script Explained** in this document for more information on the script used for inference.     


Deploy using a TFLite Model File
************************************************

Use the `Colab Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15Kv8v8JIQlj6VDDwYgwCL9pQQ2jt5BVv#scrollTo=BlNzQriZ5q9H>`_ to convert a YOLOv4 **.pb** file to a **.tflite** file. You'll need to upload the weights file that you created during the training process to your Google Drive.
