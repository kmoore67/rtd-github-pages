Telemetry
############################

When you are running code on a robot it's very useful to track how data is passing through the system as it operates.  This is referred to as *Telemetry*, which is the science of automatically collecting measurements and transmitting them to a receiving station.  Telemetry is a critical tool for fine tuning a system and figuring out why a system isn't operating the way it should. Remember, that robots are data driven machines, so in order to test our code we'll need to see the data.  

When creating Commands and Subsystems for our robot it's important to build in telemetry functions right from the start.  When testing your code on the robot things often do not go as expected at first.  In order to solve the problem quickly it's good to have the diagnostic data readily at hand.  For simple data structures you can directly output values to the *SmartDashboard* from the `periodic()` loop. 

## Network Tables

[Network Tables](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/networktables/index.html) are used to communicate between the robot, driver station, and any attached coprocessors, such as a Raspberry Pi.  Network Table values are automatically distributed to all of the systems that are connected to them.  They're a core technology used for transmitting telemetry data between the robot and dashboards.

NetworkTables classes are instantiated automatically when your program starts. There are some default tables that are created automatically at start up. As you add telemetry to your robot you'll be placing data values into these NetworkTables.

## Shuffleboard
FRC has developed a tool called *Shuffleboard*, which allows you to view all of the data that's generated from the robot in Real-Time.  It also enables you to send data to the robot in order to make commands more flexible and change the behaviour of the robot.

The documentation explains how to [Start Shuffleboard](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/shuffleboard/getting-started/shuffleboard-tour.html#starting-shuffleboard) depending on your development laptop.  

Prior to the release of the *Shuffleboard* tool FRC used an application called [SmartDashboard](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/smartdashboard/index.html).  To maintain backwards compatibilty *SmartDashboard* has been incorporated into *Shuffleboard*.  From the robot code *SmartDashboard* is still the easiest way to output telemetry data and we'll use that in the next labs.

### The Sendable Interface
The FRC documentaton has instructions on [Adding Telemetry to Robot Code](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/telemetry.html#adding-telemetry-to-robot-code). Most of this is done using the *Sendable* interface provided by WPILib that's documented in [Robot Telemetry with Sendable](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/robot-telemetry-with-sendable.html#robot-telemetry-with-sendable). The *Sendable* interface automatically sends telemetry values every robot loop, removing the need to handle the periodic logic of sending and receiving values from the dashboard.  

For simple data structures however, you can directly output values to the *SmartDashboard* from the `periodic()` loop, which is how we'll be doing it in the lab.  

## Advantage Kit
AdvantageKit is a logging framework that records all of the data flowing into the robot code. After a match, these values can be replayed to the robot code in a simulator. The log needs to be replayed using the same version of code that generated the log. More detailed logging can be done with AdvantageKit, which we'll cover in a later section.

## Lab - Telemetry
This lab builds on the code that you wrote in the Commands section of the training guide.  You'll learn about the following Java programming concepts:

- [static](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_static.asp) methods that can be accessed without creating an object of the class first.

This lab has two tasks:

- Track the current velocity and heading of the robot using *SmartDashboard*. 
- Track distance and heading using *Shuffleboard* (optional)

## Tracking Robot Velocity and Heading
In this task you'll use telemetry to track the current position and heading of the robot. The data will be output to the SmartDashboard, which is now part of Shuffleboard.  As you put data onto SmartDashboard it will automatically place it into the Network Tables.  As stated above, Network Tables are a key enabling technology for implementing telemetry.
 
 It's preferrable to keep all of the telemetry data in one place, so create a function named `publishTelemetry()` at the bottom of the *Drivetrain* file.  The function should be `public void`, since it will return no data when it's invoked by the calling function. We'll use the *SmartDashboard* class to output details for the left and right encoders together with the robot heading.  

 If you examine the *SmartDashboard* class you'll notice that all of the methods are defined as `public static`.  This means that its methods can be accessed without creating an object of the class first.  This allows us to convenienty use the SmartDashboard functionality anywhere in our code.  Use SmartDashboard's `putNumber()` method to output the left encoder rate.  The encoder rate tells us the wheel speed.  Here's an example of the syntax:

    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Left Wheel Speed", this.leftEncoder.getRate());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Right Wheel Speed", this.rightEncoder.getRate());
 
Remember that we're putting this in the `publishTelemetry()` method. Also publish the robot's heading.  The robot heading can be obtained from the `getHeading()` method of the *Drivetrain*. When you're done the code should look like this:

.. Code-block:: Java 

    public void publishTelemetry() {    
        // Display the meters per/second for each wheel and the heading
        SmartDashboard.putNumber("Left Wheel Speed", this.leftEncoder.getRate());
        SmartDashboard.putNumber("Right Wheel Speed", this.rightEncoder.getRate());
        SmartDashboard.putNumber("Heading", getHeading().getDegrees());
    }

This function can now be called from the `periodic()` method, which will place it in the robot's process loop.  Since the process loop runs 50 times per/second we'll see a continuous stream of changing data as the robot moves.

.. code-block:: Java 

    public void periodic() {
        publishTelemetry();
    }

To test, start the Simulator and view the SmartDashboard output as you move the robot.

You're now done with this task!

Track Distance and Heading using *Shuffleboard* (optional)
===============================================================
Shuffleboard is an FRC tool used for displaying telemetery data. We can configure how Shuffleboard displays data from our robot code.  Shuffleboard enables you create multiple tabs that lets you view data in a logical fashion.  This lab task shows you how to create a new Shuffleboard tab and add telemetry data to it.  The tab will be called **Drivetrain**, which will be used to see data coming from that subsystem.  

First, we should again setup a function to keep all of the code together, so create a function called `setupShuffleboard()` and place it right after the *Drivetrain*'s constructor.  The Shuffleboard layout is going to get setup when the *Drivetrain* is initialized, which is why we're putting it right after the constructor.

The syntax for adding data to a tab is quite complex.  Essentially, we have to define what data to display, how to display it, and where on the screen to place it.  See the [Shuffleboard](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/shuffleboard/index.html) documentation for details on the code syntax.  Unlike SmartDashboard, you will have to explicitly create a NetworkTable entry to hold your data value.  This is done by creating the following attribute:

    GenericEntry this.headingEntry;

The next step is to create the Shuffleboard tab to show the data.  Place this in the `setupShuffleboard()` method.  You'll need to import a couple of classes.

    ShuffleboardTab this.driveTab = Shuffleboard.getTab("Drivetrain");

After creating the tab you can start adding data components to it.  Here's the full code for creating the Shuffleboard tab and adding the robot heading:

.. code-block:: Java 

    private void setupShuffleboard() {
        // Create a tab for the Drivetrain
        ShuffleboardTab this.driveTab = Shuffleboard.getTab("Drivetrain");

        // Add telemetry data to the tab
        this.headingEntry = this.driveTab.add("Heading Deg.", getHeading())
            .withWidget(BuiltInWidgets.kGraph)      
            .withSize(3,3)
            .withPosition(0, 0)
            .getEntry();  
    }

Our `setupShuffleboard()` method gets called from the *Drivetrain*'s constructor to make it visible in Shuffleboard as soon as the robot starts up.

.. code-block:: Java 

    public Drivetrain() {
        ...
        setupShuffleboard();
    }

Telemetry data needs to be put into the NetworkTables to become visible in Shuffleboard.  The following code is placed in the `publishTelemetry()` method using the table entry that you defined earlier.  Data types for NetworkTables are either boolean, numeric, or string. Numeric values are written as `double` precision values. 

.. code-block:: Java 

    this.headingEntry.setDouble(getHeading());

Since `publishTelemetry()` is called from the `periodic()` function, this statement will populate the NetworkTable entry every 50 milliseconds giving you a Real-Time view of the data. 

Continue on and add some more telemetry data to the **Drivetrain** tab.  Add three variables `this.leftWheelPositionEntry`, `this.rightWheelPositionEntry`, and `this.avgDistanceEntry` to track how far we've travelled.  Use the methods `getLeftDistanceMeters()`, `getRightDistanceMeters()`, and `getAverageDistanceMeters()` to populate the data entries.  Follow the example above to add the entries to the **Drivetrain** tab.

Here's how the entries should look once you've added them.  

.. code-block:: Java 

    this.leftWheelPositionEntry = this.driveTab.add("Left Wheel Pos.", getLeftDistanceMeters())
        .withWidget(BuiltInWidgets.kGraph)      
        .withSize(3,3)  
        .withPosition(4, 0)
        .getEntry();  
    this.rightWheelPositionEntry = this.driveTab.add("Right Wheel Pos.", getRightDistanceMeters())
        .withWidget(BuiltInWidgets.kGraph)      
        .withSize(3,3)
        .withPosition(7, 0)
        .getEntry(); 
    this.avgDistanceEntry = this.driveTab.add("Average Distance", getAverageDistanceMeters())
        .withWidget(BuiltInWidgets.kGraph)      
        .withSize(3,3)
        .withPosition(10, 0)
        .getEntry();     

Once again, the entries are of type GenericEntry, which need to be defined as attributes of the *Drivetrain* class. 

Place the following statements in the `publishTelemetry()` method to put the data into the NetworkTables and see them in Shuffleboard.

.. code-block:: Java 
    
    // Display the distance travelled for each wheel
    this.leftWheelPositionEntry.setDouble(getLeftDistanceMeters());
    this.rightWheelPositionEntry.setDouble(getRightDistanceMeters()); 
    this.avgDistanceEntry.setDouble(getAverageDistanceMeters());

You can now check out the telemetry data by running the Romi robot. 

You're now done with this task!
