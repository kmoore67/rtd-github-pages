Once the new FRC game is announced, our engineering teams will begin the process of designing and constructing a robot to execute the game requirements. As such, it might be a few weeks before the first competition robot (commonly known as the Practice Robot) will be available for our use. Typically, the programming team needs every day it can get in the short 6-week build season to write the robot controls, so waiting for the robot to be completed before we start coding is not an option. This is where robot simulation can really be a benefit to the programming team.

Simulation allows the programming team to begin developing code immeadiately. This allows us to get the logic of how the robot will perform written and tested so that when the robot is available, we can make the best use of our remaining time in the 6-week schedule. Accordingly, this is where we will begin your training- **with simulation**. The goal is to enable you to write your code, and test it without the robot. In fact, you should be able to write the code at home between programming team meetings!

So the very first session will get you up and running in simulation with some sample code.  Once you can master that, we will move on to the structure of robot programs. The Subsystems and Command modules will give you more detailed insight into how robot programming works and how best for you to construct your robot programming. Once you get this working in simulation, it will be time for you to port your code to the real robots. Keep in mind that simulation is great, and we need to ensure that you are exceptional using it, but some things can only be run on a real robot (such as tuning PID parameters, or timing between functions, or the speed at which a mechanical mechanism actually moves.) So, we will end with your code running on the programmming test robot. This is the best way for us to ensure you are ready for the season kick-off.

By the time you finish the tutorials you will have a firm grasp on how to program FRC robots, and the code that you develop will translate almost directly over to programming the robots used for the competition!

**So time is short, and you have a lot to learn, so let's get started.**
