Robot Structure 
########################################


The structure of the competition roboRIO robot is very similar to that of the example code you have been working with.  The subsystems, game controllers, and *AutoChooser* menu are all defined within the *RobotContainer* class above its constructor.  The subsystems are configured when the *RobotContainer* object is constructed.  Each subsystem will designate its default command, which is the command that runs when no other command is using the subsystem, and setup any game controller buttons that are used to control the subsystem.

The **autoChooser** menu is also created when the *RobotContainer* object is built.  The **autoChooser** menu is used to select an autonomous command. The general structure of the *RobotContainer* class is show below.

The game controllers will be mapped to commands in the *configureBindings* method in the *RobotContainer* class.  You'll learn how to do this in the Joysticks and Game Controllers  tutorial.

Lab - Robot Structure
***************************************

The purpose of this lab is to learn about the roboRIO training robot's code structure and practice deploying your own code to the robot.  There are four tasks for this lab:

- Fork the *Sweetpants2024* program for the roboRIO training robot into your own Github account.

- Clone to *Sweetpants2024* program to your laptop.

- Learn about the roboRIO training robot and it's code structure.  

- Drive the *Sweetpants* training robot from your own laptop.  Execute the *AutonomousTime* and *AutonomousDistance* command to ensure that they work.  Then drive the robot around with a game controller.

### Fork the Reference Program
We're going to start our training on the roboRIO robots by **Forking** a reference program for a robot that we call *Sweetpants*. This will put a copy of the program into your own Github account so as you can make changes to it.

1. Navigate to the [Sweetpants2024](https://github.com/FRC-2928/Sweetpants2024) program for the training roboRIO robot.  

2. Follow the instructions on [Forking a Repository](../Tools/git.md#gitFork) to get a copy of the program into your own Github account.

3. Check your Github account to ensure that the new repository has been copied.  While you're there copy the repository URL by clicking on the **Code** button.

You're now done with this task!

### Clone the Reference Program
Now that you have a copy of the reference program in your own Github repository you can clone it onto your laptop and make changes to it.

1. In VSCode, clone the reference program for the roboRIO training robot from your own *Sweetpants2024* repository.  For a reminder on how to do this refer to Cloning a Repository(../Tools/git.md#gitClone).

Once you have your own personal of the reference program you're done with this task!

### Learn about the roboRIO Robot
The purpose of this task is to familiarize youself with the roboRIO robot.  We'll look at the code structure and also take a some physical measurements of the robot so as we can use them in our code.

1. Look at the *RobotContainer* class in VSCode and identify each code block that's shown in the RobotContainer Structure image above.

2. Look at the *Drivetrain* class and examine the `getAvgDistanceMeters()` method.  Calculating this return value is a little more complex than on the Romi.  This is because the roboRIO training robot has a transmission, which changes the distance calculation depending on whether it's in high or low gear.  Try and follow the code through and understand how the distance is calculated.

3. Measure the track width, wheel diameter, and wheel width on the *Sweetpants* robot and create or confirm the constants `kTrackWidthMeters`, `kWheelDiameterMeters`, and `kWheelWidthMeters` in the *Constants* file.

4. Sometimes we'll want to turn the robot on the spot, so it would be useful to know how far each wheel has to turn to represent one degree of rotation of the robot.  This is why we need `kTrackWidthMeters`.  The calulation for this is done in the following diagram.  Note that this is an example, you'll need to get the actual track width measurement from the robot.

![Rotation Degrees](../../images/FRCKinematics&Odometry/FRCKinematics&Odometry.013.jpeg)

The meters per/degree calculation appears in the `isFinished()` method of the *TurnDegrees* command.  

.. code-block:: Java 

    public boolean isFinished() {
        double metersPerDegree = Math.PI * DrivetrainConstants.kTrackWidthMeters / 360;

        // Compare distance travelled from start to distance based on degree turn
        return getAverageTurningDistance() >= (metersPerDegree * m_degrees);
    }

The distance needs to be averaged over the two wheels, which is done in the `getAverageTurningDistance()` method of the *TurnDegrees* command.  

.. code-block:: Java 
    
    private double getAverageTurningDistance() {
        double leftDistance = Math.abs(m_drive.getLeftDistanceMeters());
        double rightDistance = Math.abs(m_drive.getRightDistanceMeters());
        return (leftDistance + rightDistance) / 2.0;
    }

After taking the measurements and reviewing the code you're done with this task!

### Drive the *Sweetpants* Training Robot
In this task you'll drive the *Sweetpants* robot from your own laptop using the *Sweetpants2024* code that you copied into your Github repository.  If you don't have a Windows laptop you can use one of the team laptops.  

1. Connect to the robot and run the DriverStation.  See [Understand the Driver Station](driverStation.md#dsUnderstand) from the previous lab.

2. Deploy the *Sweetpants2024* code from your laptop. See [Deploy Robot Code](driverStation.md#dsUnderstand) from the previous lab.

3. Execute the *AutonomousDistance* command from the *SendableChooser* menu by selecting *Autonomous* mode from the DriverStation and "Enabling" the robot.  This command does the same thing as the *AutonomousDistance* command on the Romi.  It drives forward, turns 180 degrees, drives back, and turns another 180 degrees.  The last two steps of the command have been commented out, since we want to ensure that the robot turns approximately 180 degrees before doing the return leg of the trip. Once You've confirmed that the robot is pointing in the right direction you can uncomment the last two sequential commands.

4. Do the same test for the *AutonomousTime* command.  You'll have to startup Shuffleboard so as you can select the command, since *AutonomousTime* is not the default command.

5. Connect a game controller to your laptop and drive the robot around.

You're now done with this task!
