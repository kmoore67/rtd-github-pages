USB Camera Deployment for Jetson Nano
####################################################

Since the Jetson has a GPU we can use a regular Pi or USB camera to detect the objects of interest.  The deployment below uses Jetpack 4.6 as the base Jetson installation.  In order to run on the Jetson's CUDA GPU you need to convert the **.weights** file, that was created when you trained the Yolo model, into a TensorRT **.trt** file format.  To setup the environment we need to do the following:

* Install required packages for file convertion and inference.
* Install the FRC deployment scripts for the Jetson Nano.
* Convert the **.weights** file to a TensorRT file that will run on the Jetson GPU.
* Run the inference script.

Installing Required Packages
---------------------------------------------------

Install tensorrt_demos.  This set of demos is maintained by JK Jung.  See his `TensorRT YOLO For Custom Trained Models <https://jkjung-avt.github.io/trt-yolo-custom-updated/>`_ blog post for more information.

.. code-block:: 

    git clone https://github.com/jkjung-avt/tensorrt_demos.git
    cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos

Install pycuda:

.. code-block:: 

    cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos/yolo
    ./install_pycuda.sh

Install protobuf by running this installation `script <https://github.com/jkjung-avt/jetson_nano/blob/master/install_protobuf-3.8.0.sh>`_ or installing with pip:


.. code-block:: Python 

    sudo pip3 install protobuf

Install onnx version "1.4.1" (not the latest version) of python3 "onnx" module. Note that the "onnx" module would depend on "protobuf". 


.. code-block:: Python 

    sudo pip3 install onnx==1.4.1

Go to the "plugins/" subdirectory and build the "yolo_layer" plugin. When done, a "libyolo_layer.so" would be generated.


.. code-block:: 

    cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos/plugins
    make

Installing the FRC Detection Scripts
---------------------------------------------------

In order to run the OAK-D camera and display the detected objects you need to deploy a custom python script that is specific to the type of detection model that you want to deploy.  In our case, we're going to use the **YoloV4-Tiny** model.  The script will use a default model that detects various common objects and display the output to a Web URL. It'll also place information about objects that have been detected into Network Tables so a it can be used by your WPILib java program.

To deploy the script follow these steps:

* Clone the FRC models and python scripts from GitHub:

.. code-block:: 

        cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos
        git lfs clone https://github.com/FRC-2928/FRC-Jetson-Deployment-Models.git

* Install the python requirements for the FRC scripts. The requirements are `pkgconfig`, `robotpy-cscore`, and `Pillow`. `robotpy-cscore` installs the *WPI Network Tables*. This can take 10-15 minutes to install.

.. code-block:: 

        cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos/FRC-Jetson-Deployment-Models
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

* Move the FRC inference script to the parent directory:

.. code-block::  

    cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos
    cp FRC-Jetson-Deployment-Models/trt_yolo_wpi.py .
    cp FRC-Jetson-Deployment-Models/wpi_helpers.py .

Doing the Conversion
-------------------------------------------

The conversion scripts are in the following directory:

.. code-block:: 

    cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos/yolo

Convert weights file to ONNX:

.. code-block:: Python 

    python3 yolo_to_onnx.py -m yolov4

Convert ONNX file to TensorRT:

.. code-block:: Python

    python3 onnx_to_tensorrt.py -m yolov4-416

Running Inference
-----------------------------------------

A default model is supplied in the *FRC-Jetson-Deployment-Models* package that detects the *Rapid-React* balls from the 2022 competition.  To use that model run the following commands.  Make sure that the inference scripts have been moved to the **${HOME}/tensorrt_demos** directory as stated above.

.. code-block:: 

        cd ${HOME}/tensorrt_demos

To run the inference using an attached Raspberry Pi camera.  

.. code-block:: 

    cd ${HOME}tensorrt_demos
    python3 trt_yolo_wpi.py --onboard 0 -m rapid-react

For a USB camera:    

.. code-block:: Python 

    python3 trt_yolo_wpi.py --usb 1 -m rapid-react

You can display the output stream in a desktop gui window like this:  

.. code-block:: Python

    python3 trt_yolo_wpi.py --usb 1 -m rapid-react --gui

The Inference Script
********************************************

This script connects to the USB camera and passes images to the inference model.  If an object-of-interest is detected a bounding box is drawn on the image together with positional data.  The positional data is put into the Network Tables so as it can be made use of by the WPILib robot program.  The overlayed images can be viewed in a Web browser.

The `python inference script <https://github.com/FRC-2928/FRC-Jetson-Deployment-Models/blob/main/trt_yolo_wpi.py>`_ can be found on FRC-2928 GitHub account. For a descripton of how this script works see **The Inference Script Explained** in this document.
