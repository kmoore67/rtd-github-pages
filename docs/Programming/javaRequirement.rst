The Java Requirement
=============================

**WARNING -- you are expected to have at least a basic understanding of Java to become a member of the programming team!!**

We must spend most of our training time teaching you how to use Java in the FRC World. As such we can not spend a lot of time teaching basic Java.

Please come to the start of the training season with an understanding of how to write Java code. If you feel you need to brush up on your Java skills, please see the links below to websites that hava Java tutorials that will help develop your Java skills.
