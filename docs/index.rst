FRC Training
======================================

This site hosts training resources for programming teams involved in the First Robotics Competition (FRC). 
The aim is to give the student a good grounding in both robotics and programming. 
The purpose of the training is to take you step-by-step through the process of becoming an FRC programmer.
This will prepare you to write code for the competition robot that your mechanical and electrical engineering teams will build. 
In order not to duplicate information that already exists there are plenty of references to the `FIRST Robotic Competition <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ documentation.

The subjects that will be covered in this course will include:

First, we'll start out setting up a development environment on your laptop so that you will have something to train with. Next, we'll move on to the main learning path using **Robot Simulation**.  And finally, as you advance, we'll move on to the **Sweet Bench** and the **Programming Team Camera Robot** and hopefully the **Competition Practice Bot**.  From there we'll link to other parts of the training resources.

==================

This document was inspired by the public Read-the-Docs document developed by FRC 2928. Rather than 're-invent the wheel', some of this documents content comes directly from the orginal FRC 2928 document. The author greatly appreciates all the work that FRC 2928 has accomplished and thanks them for giving us somewhere to start.
